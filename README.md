# COVID-Analysis-
You can find the dataset used for this project [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

The dataset was then made into two separate excel sheets, one named COVID deaths and the other is Covid vaccine. 

Please refer to this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ria.al2315/viz/COVIDDashboard_17059620845490/Dashboard1) to see the visuals of the queries using Tableau.
