Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization repository! This SQL code explores and visualizes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using data from the "COVIDdeaths$" and "COVIDVaccine$" tables in the "Portfolio" database.

You can find the dataset used for this project [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
